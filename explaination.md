# Explaination
For explaination for my solution for the first , </br>I have to remove all character that are not digit by using regularexpression and replace them with "".
</br> next I create covert string to int function by using ASCII trick, that I subtrack digit charater with '0', then I'll get only corresponding value from that charqacter.</br>
It is a integer value.
